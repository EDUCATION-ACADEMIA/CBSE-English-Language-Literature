The roots of the tree grow deep and hold it firmly in the soil. So, only a chop cannot kill the tree because it will slowly heal up and grow to its original shape and size.Over the years, the tree has grown strong and hence, it will take much time to kill a tree.The tree is finally killed when its roots are uprooted and it scorches and chokes in sunlight and air.
