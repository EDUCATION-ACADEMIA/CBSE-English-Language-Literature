Answer: He cursed her and made her a woodpecker.She tried baking two more times but even the smallest of cakes seemed too large to her. Such greedy behaviour of the lady annoyed the hungry saint. He cursed her saying that she was far too selfish to be a human, to have food, shelter and fire to keep her warm. Thus, she was transformed into a woodpecker.Saint Peter became angry at her greed because she did not give a piece of cake to Saint Peter to satiate his hunger.
