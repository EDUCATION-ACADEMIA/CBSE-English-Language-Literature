<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: the newspaper proclaimed his work as a scientific revolution. In 1915, he had published his general theory of relativity, which provided a new interpretation of gravity. An eclipse of the sun in 1919 brought proof that it was accurate, thus giving the world famous formula .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An eclipse of the sun in 1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein had correctly calculated in advance the extent to which the light from fixed stars would be deflected through the sun’s gravitational field. The newspapers proclaimed his work as “a scientific revolution.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Albert Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels, according to Wired (opens in new tab).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-On November 7, 1919 The Times of London reported, “Revolution in Science, New Theory of the Universe, Newtonian Ideas Overthrown, ” sparking a media frenzy that launched Einstein into the limelight virtually overnight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some Consequences of General Relativity are : Clocks in the deeper gravitational wells run slower than in general gravitational levels. Light rays will bend in the gravitational field. The universe is expanding, and parts of it are moving away from Earth faster than the speed of light.
