He told the bird to pluck his second eye and give the sapphire to that girl. The prince then became completely blind and the bird decided to not leave and to live with him and help the poor.He sent the sapphire to the young playwright so that he could sell it to the jeweller, buy firewood, and finish his play. On seeing the sapphire, the young man felt appreciated and believed that he could finish his play.

Her matches had fallen into the gutter. She was afraid that her father would beat her if she did not bring home some money. So, the prince helped her by sending her the second sapphire.">
