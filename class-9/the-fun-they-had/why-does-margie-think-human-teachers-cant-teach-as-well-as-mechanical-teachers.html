She hated the part when she had to insert the homework and test papers in the slot on the mechanical teacher.The problem that Margie was facing with the mechanical teacher was that its geography part was set too fast and the tests were taken very frequently and Margi wasnt able to get the lessons. And because she was not doing good in the tests and get scolded by her mom, thats why she hated it.">
