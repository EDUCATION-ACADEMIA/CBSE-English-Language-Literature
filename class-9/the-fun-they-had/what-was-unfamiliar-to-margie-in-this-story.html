<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Margie found it strange that the words printed on a book stood still instead of moving the way they did on a screen. She also found it odd that the words on a page always remained the same as the first time they were read. Besides, the idea that someone would write a book about schools was itself strange for Margie.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-She thought that the old schools must have been fun because the students used to sit together in the classroom. They enjoyed, laughed and shouted in the schoolyard. Children needed company to enhance their skills.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Margie was disappointed because she hated school and hoped that her mechanical teacher would be taken away for repairs as Tommy’s teacher was once taken away for a month. But when the County Inspector promptly repaired and reset it at her home itself, she was unhappy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Their teacher is a real person who makes them sit together and teaches them the same topic. In this way, they learn to adjust and adapt which helps them develop the values of tolerance and cooperation. Hence, Margie’s view that schools today are more fun than her school is totally justified.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Margie understood so many things about the old school days from her grandfather. She realized that all the students went to the class with great appalause and joy and studied in a particular building rather than what Margie had(ie, single room).
