<meta name="description" content="Explanation: Kezia often had a nightmare. In the nightmare she often saw a butcher with a knife and a rope, who came nearer and nearer, smiling that dreadful smile; while she could not move, could only stand still, crying out, Grandma!Although Kezia tried sleeping, the same old nightmare came back to her. In it, she saw a butcher with a knife and rope approaching her, bearing an evil smile. She was so scared that she could only stand up and cry out.Kezia often used to have a nightmare in which she saw a butcher with a knife. The butcher also had a rope with him. His smile was very dreadful, which made Kezia wake up in fear. Her father helped her when she shrieked out in fear of the nightmare.He tells Butcher that everyone thats ever loved him, dies because of his actions. He then proceeds to kill himself with the gun. Butcher carried a lot of guilt for leaving his brother and all of it manifested in this nightmare.So now this is a nightmare that Kezia had often-she would see a butcher. So this butcher would hold a big knife-a huge butchers knife and a rope and he would approach Kezia. He had a dreadful smile on his face. And once Kezia would see him, she would feel that she was unable to move.">
