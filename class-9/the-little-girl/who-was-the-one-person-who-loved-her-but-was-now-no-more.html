<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: No, the story of ‘The Little Match Girl’ is not based on true events.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the matches are gone, the girl freezes to death, and her grandmother carries her soul to Heaven. The next morning, passers-by find the girl’s body with a smile on her face, and express pity.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
