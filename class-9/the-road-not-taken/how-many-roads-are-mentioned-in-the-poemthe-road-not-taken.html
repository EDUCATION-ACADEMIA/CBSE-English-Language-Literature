<title>How many roads are mentioned in the poemThe Road Not Taken
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The two roads in The Road Not Taken hardly differ. The first road is described as bending into the undergrowth. The second road is described as just as fair, though it was grassy and wanted wear.(i) The poet sees two roads diverging in a yellow wood. Perhaps it was autumn and both the roads were covered with dead or fallen yellow leaves. The first one went down in the undergrowth of the forest. The other road was equally beautiful, grassy and wanted wear.This poem by Robert Frost describes the dilemma a walker faces when the path he is treading diverges into two roads. The two roads are, in fact, nearly identical. The first one, as the speaker looks down it, takes a bend into the undergrowth of the forest, precluding him from seeing its end.But we, the readers, know that it wasnt taking that road that made the difference. In fact, that road that I took, it wasnt any less traveled by than the first. We know that from the first and second stanzas. The roads were the same.Ans: The poet Robert Frost chose the road less travelled by when he was faced with two roads that diverged in a yellow wood .">
