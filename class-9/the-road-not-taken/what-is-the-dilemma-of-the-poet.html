<title>What is the dilemma of the poet?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer: The poets dilemma was that he did not know which road he had to choose when the road split into two. He looked down to one road and realised that, that road was taken by most of the people. The other road was covered in grass and proves that very less people have taken that road.The poet was standing before the two roads. He had to decide which one would lead him to success.The poet has the dilemma of fear of losing her mother the fear tortures her every time the thought of losing her mother comes to her.Answer: The traveller finds himself in the yellow woods at a point where the two roads diverge. The problem that he faces is that he cannot decide which road to take to continue his journey.Answer: The dilemma the speaker of the poem faces is choosing between two paths. He has come to a fork in the road, which symbolically means that He has come to a point of change in his life, where he was either going to go one way or the other.">
