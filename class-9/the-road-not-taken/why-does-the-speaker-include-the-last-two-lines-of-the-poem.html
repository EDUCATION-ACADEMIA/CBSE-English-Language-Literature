<title>Why does the speaker include the last two lines of the poem
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Solution : The last two lines of the poem mean the acceptance of reality. The poet made a choice and accepted the challenging path. He took and unexplored path in his life. He wanted to do something different in his life so he chooses the less travelled road.In the last line of the poem, the speaker is telling his brothers to row till the edge of the verge where the sky and the sea seem to mate which refers to the point where the sky touches the sea.At the end of the poem, the speaker asserts that choosing the road less traveled has made all the difference-the suggestion being that he or she has led a life of nonconformity, and is happier because of it.In the poem, the speaker does take the road less traveled by, but in the end, he says hell tell the story with a sigh, which means he will probably regret his choice // will be sorry that he chose the more challenging path.Solution. The speaker doesnt seem to be happy about his decision. Whether the choice is right or wrong cant be decided on the spur of the moment.">
