Answer: Robert Frost chose the road which others avoided or seldom took. This indicates that the poet is brave and adventurous.The poet had to make a choice between the two roads that diverged in front of him. One of the two roads was grassy, which meant that it was less travelled by and had scope for some adventure. Whereas, the other road was much travelled by and thus, was less grassy.">
