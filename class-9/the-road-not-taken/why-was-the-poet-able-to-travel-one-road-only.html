In his journey he saw that two roads were diverging in the woods. Hence the poet was able to travel in one road only.Answer: The poet took the road which was less travelled as it was grassy and less worn. The poet regretted his decision as he thought that he would have been successful if he would have taken the other road and so his life would have been different.The poet means that he feels sorry because he can not travel both the roads. He has to choose one road and leave the other one for another day. The word that expresses his regret about this is-sorry.In the poem the poet describes how life goes unidirectionally. He is doubtful of not being able to walk the first road in the future because once we move forward in our life, we can not come back. Hope this helps.">
