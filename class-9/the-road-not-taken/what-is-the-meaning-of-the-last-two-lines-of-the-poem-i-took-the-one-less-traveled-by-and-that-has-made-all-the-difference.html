<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The difference is probably the degree ofsuccess which he has achieved and the amount of happiness and fulfilment he must have felt by travelling the unexplored way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-We see this in the last lines of the poem, which read: I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. Essentially, the speaker is saying that later in life he will look back in time and see that moment as one of great significance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Solution. The poet says “I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference”. The difference is that he did not choose that way of life which most people generally choose to get easy success, fame and money in life. On the other hand, he chose the road that was “less travelled by”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The last two lines very well explains the central theme of the poem, that is, the fact that human life is mortal while the beauty of nature remains eternal. The brook says in these lines that human lives come to an end and another generation begins. However, the flow of the brook is continuous and goes on forever.
