Having no response on the part of his parents he realises that he has lost his way.When he saw the roundabout in a full swing, he made a bold request to his parents to have a ride on it. But, there was no reply. When he turned to look at his parents, there was no one. That is when he realized that he had lost his way.His anxiety and insecurities have been described when his body jerked and a deep cry arose from his dry throat. He was filled with fear as tears rolled down his eyes. Panic stricken, he ran from side to side in search of his parents. He thrusted his way between peoples feet and was knocked to and fro by the passersby.What was his immediate reaction? On not getting any reply to his bold request for a ride on a roundabout, the child turned back and noticed that his parents were not there. He realized at this moment that he had got lost. Filled with fear and panic, he ran wailing in all directions calling aloud for his parents.Now the child realized that he was lost. He ran here and there but could not find them. The place was overcrowded. He got terrified but suddenly a kind-hearted man took him up in his arms and consoled the bitterly weeping child.">
