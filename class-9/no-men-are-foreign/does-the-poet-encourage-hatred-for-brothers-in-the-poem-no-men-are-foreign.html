<title>Does the poet encourage hatred for brothers in the poem No Men Are Foreign?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer: The poet wants to say that there should be no discrimination or enmity between people on the basis of their appearance religion or region. It is inhuman to hate one because of ones different background. The poet wants that the people should love their fellow human beings as all men are brothers.Through hating our brothers, the poet reminds us, we are dispossessing, betraying, and punishing ourselves. We pollute the human earth and violate the integrity of the atmosphere as we take arms against each other. Note: No Men Are Foreign, a poem by James Kirkup, is about brotherhood and equality.When someone tells us to hate someone of another country and think then as our enemy and we do that then we deprive, condemn, and cheat ourselves. The poet says that we should stay away from such negativity.Answer: The poet refers to the people living in other countries as our brothers. He says so because the superficial dissimilarities of complexion, language, dress, culture and nationality do not, and must not, segregate us as human beings.Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange.-this line is repeated throughout the poem. The poet uses this repetition to put emphasis on the theme of world fraternity and also because he wants us to remember that no men are foreign and no countries strange.">
