<title>How did the poet feel after his beloveds death?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The death of the poets beloved is so sudden and unexpected that his mind as well as his body seems to be closed off. A deep slumber has taken hold over him. His spirit seems to be sealed. He has lost touch of earthly consciousness.Though his loved ones death has left the poet numb and the common human fears no longer affected him, his reaction cannot be labelled as bitter grief. This is because by the end of the poem, we come to know that the poet imagines her to be a part of nature, rotating with the earth on its axis.Answer: The poet is shocked at the death of his loved one and feels great pain. He does not feel bitter grief that he could shed out in the form of tears. He just looked at her and wondered how she looked and what she would experience later.Does he feel bitter grief? Or does he feel great peace? Ans: At the death of his loved one, the poets mind and soul are devoid of any human fears or sensations. He has the impression that his intellect has been numbed by a profound slumber that prevents him from feeling either bitter anguish or wonderful peace.In this stanza, the poet expresses his grief over the death of a loved one. He says that he is so shocked by the death of a loved one that he feels that his soul has gone into a deep sleep. He has become completely numb and senseless. Now the poet does not have any human fears like loss, death, etc.">
