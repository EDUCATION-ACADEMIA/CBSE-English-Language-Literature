<title>What lie did Lushkoff tell Sergei in Sadovya Street
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ans. In order to beg alms and earn sympathy, Lushkoff told different lies to people. He would claim to be a student who had been expelled or a village schoolteacher who had lost his job because of the intrigues and lies of others.The first reason he gives for lying is that he used to sing in a Russian choir but was sent away due to drunkenness. Therefore he is now unemployed. The second reason he gives is no one would give him any money if he spoke the truth. Was this answer helpful?Ans. :-Lushkoff tells Sergei that he was telling lies because no one would help him if he told the truth about his drunkenness. Instead, lies helped him get both sympathy and money that he required desperately to keep himself alive.Then he had told him that he was a student and had been expelled for not paying his fees. At first, the beggar denied the charge. But when Sergei rebuked him, he admitted that he earned his living by lying. He told Sergei that his name was Lushkoff and that he was out of work.">
