He had shown interest in Lushkoffs life and had felt happy to see him reformed.Ans: –A close look at the beggars face made Sergei think that he had seen the man somewhere before. Then his eyes fell on his overshoes, one of which was high and the other was low. This made Sergei remember suddenly that he had seen this beggar in Sadovya Street a couple of days before.First is that he says he is a poor student in need of money. Second is that he lies he was a schoolmaster who has lost his job. There was a new job offer but he did not have money to travel. The Third was that Lushkoff lies to Sergei that he chopped the woods to get the money although it was done by Sergeis maid Olga.Ans. :-Sergei helped Lushkoff to live respectfully by giving him odd jobs every time he came to the yard. Now Lushkoff did not need to beg alms since he got money for all the little tasks that he was given by Sergei.How does Lushkoff pay credit to Sergei? Answer: He says that he was indebted to Sergei for his push, because he would never have changed for the better, but would have continued to deceive people and beg.
