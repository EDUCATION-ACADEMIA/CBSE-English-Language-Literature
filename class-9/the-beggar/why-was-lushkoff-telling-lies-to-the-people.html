He would claim to be a student who had been expelled or a village schoolteacher who had lost his job because of the intrigues and lies of others.Ans. :-Lushkoff tells Sergei that he was telling lies because no one would help him if he told the truth about his drunkenness. Instead, lies helped him get both sympathy and money that he required desperately to keep himself alive.Lushkoff is a beggar who tells blatant lies about his plight to arouse the sympathy of others and get alms in return.Ans. Sergei sent Lushkoff to his friend with a letter of recommendation for some copying work. This was a cleaner employment in comparison to wood-chopping. As a parting advice, he told Lushkoff to work hard and not to drink.One day a beggar came to Sergei, an advocate, and asked for help. The beggar had worn a fawn-coloured tattered overcoat and had dull, drunken eyes with the red spot on either cheek. He told Sergei that he had been a village schoolteacher for eight years but had lost his job because of scheming and lies.">
